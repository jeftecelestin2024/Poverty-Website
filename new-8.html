    <p class="specialpara">This is a graph that shows poverty by age group. Its shows that about 15% of people under the age of 18 are living in poverty. Around 10% of people between 18 and 64 are living in poverty. The last part of the graph shows that around 10% of people 65 and older live in poverty. When the numbers are calculated this is an absurd amount of people that live in poverty.</p>
